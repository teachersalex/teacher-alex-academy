I'm still learning the rules because basketball isn't as popular in Brazil as football. My biggest challenge is shooting three-pointers - I only make 2 out of 10 attempts! The other players are very patient and help me improve my technique. Basketball is great exercise and burns 400 calories per hour according to my fitness app. I'm getting better each week!\",\n    questions: [\n      {\n        question: \"How many evenings per week does she play?\",\n        options: [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\"],\n        correct: 1\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"Until what time do the court lights stay on?\",\n        options: [\"9 PM\", \"10 PM\", \"11 PM\", \"Midnight\"],\n        correct: 1\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"How many players meet for pickup games?\",\n        options: [\"8\", \"10\", \"12\", \"14\"],\n        correct: 1\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"How many three-pointers does she make out of 10 attempts?\",\n        options: [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\"],\n        correct: 1\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"How many calories does basketball burn per hour?\",\n        options: [\"300\", \"350\", \"400\", \"450\"],\n        correct: 2\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'sports-10',\n    title: 'Coaching Kids\\' Football',\n    description: 'Learn about community involvement and youth sports',\n    duration: '40s',\n    icon: 'üë®‚Äçüè´',\n    audioFile: 'audio/a1-sports/audio-10-coaching-kids.mp3',\n    script: \"I volunteer as a football coach for kids aged 8 to 12 in my neighborhood! Practice is every Saturday morning from 9 AM to 11 AM at the local school field. I have 18 kids on my team and they're full of energy and enthusiasm. We focus on basic skills like passing, dribbling, and teamwork rather than winning games. The kids call me 'Professora Ana' and always ask for extra practice time. Last month we played a friendly match against another school and tied 3-3. Seeing these children develop their skills and make new friends through football makes me incredibly happy!\",\n    questions: [\n      {\n        question: \"What ages are the kids she coaches?\",\n        options: [\"6 to 10\", \"7 to 11\", \"8 to 12\", \"9 to 13\"],\n        correct: 2\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"How long does each practice session last?\",\n        options: [\"1.5 hours\", \"2 hours\", \"2.5 hours\", \"3 hours\"],\n        correct: 1\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"How many kids are on her team?\",\n        options: [\"15\", \"16\", \"18\", \"20\"],\n        correct: 2\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"What do the kids call her?\",\n        options: [\"Coach Ana\", \"Teacher Ana\", \"Professora Ana\", \"Miss Ana\"],\n        correct: 2\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"What was the score in their friendly match?\",\n        options: [\"2-2\", \"3-3\", \"4-4\", \"1-1\"],\n        correct: 1\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n];"],"names":["SPORTS_LESSONS","id","title","description","duration","icon","audioFile","script","questions","question","options","correct"],"sourceRoot":""}
