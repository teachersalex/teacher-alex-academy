During the World Cup, the entire country stops - banks close early, offices have TVs, and even grandmothers become football experts! I remember in 2002 when Brazil won the World Cup in Japan, people cried tears of joy in the streets. We have produced legends like Pel√©, Ronaldinho, and Ronaldo who are known worldwide.
