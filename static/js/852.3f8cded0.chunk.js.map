The walls are painted black and I have LED strips that change colors. My gaming desk is L-shaped and fits three monitors perfectly. I invested in a Herman Miller gaming chair that cost 2,500 reais - expensive but worth it for long gaming sessions. The room has no windows, so I can game 24 hours without sunlight bothering me. I upgrade my setup every two years to keep everything modern.\",\n    questions: [\n      {\n        question: \"Where is her gaming room located?\",\n        options: [\"Bedroom\", \"Living room\", \"Basement\", \"Attic\"],\n        correct: 2\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"What color are the walls painted?\",\n        options: [\"White\", \"Blue\", \"Red\", \"Black\"],\n        correct: 3\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"How many monitors fit on her desk?\",\n        options: [\"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\"],\n        correct: 1\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"How much did her gaming chair cost?\",\n        options: [\"1,500 reais\", \"2,000 reais\", \"2,500 reais\", \"3,000 reais\"],\n        correct: 2\n      },\n      {\n        question: \"How often does she upgrade her setup?\",\n        options: [\"Every year\", \"Every two years\", \"Every three years\", \"Every five years\"],\n        correct: 1\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    id: 'gaming-10',\n    title: 'Virtual Reality Future',\n    description: 'Learn about VR technology and future gaming trends',\n    duration: '40s',\n    icon: 'ü•Ω',\n    audioFile: 'audio/a1-gaming/audio-10-virtual-reality.mp3',\n    script: \"Virtual Reality is the future of gaming! I tried my friend's Oculus Quest 2 last month and it was incredible. The immersion level is amazing - you really feel like you're inside the game world. Right now VR headsets cost around 3,000 reais in Brazil, which is too expensive for most people. I think in five years the technology will be cheaper and more accessible.
