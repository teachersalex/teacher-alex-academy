I enrolled in a 6-month digital marketing program that costs 2,400 reais total, paid in 12 installments of 200 reais each. The course includes 40 video lessons, 15 practical assignments, and live webinars every Friday at 8 PM. I study for 2 hours every evening after work and take notes in both Portuguese and English. My goal is to earn a certificate that will help me transition from traditional marketing to digital marketing roles. Learning in English is challenging but prepares me for international opportunities.
